# Study-Central

# How to Get Started

1. Install MAMP or XAMP depending on whether you are using Windows/Mac
	(Study Central uses PHP and requires an active server to run)
2. Inside the /inc/database.php file, replace the Host name, host password, username, and password fields with your own information

3. Youâ€™re ready to go!
